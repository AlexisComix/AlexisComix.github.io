This is my website, but I have not updated this since I was in Year 12. 
Looong time ago. I will probably update this over the summer for a bit,
depending on how many portfolio projects I can get done. I will make this a
portfolio website, because no student in this economy can afford a web host. 
Thanks GitHub!
